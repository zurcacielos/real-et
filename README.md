# Real-Et: Azure Key Vault Comparer

Real-Et is a professional developer tool designed to visually compare secrets across multiple Azure Key Vault environments (e.g., Dev, Stg, UAT, QA). It allows you to instantly identify mismatches, missing secrets, and uniform values across your infrastructure.

## Prerequisites
- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Authentication
This application uses your active Azure CLI session to authenticate against Azure Key Vaults.
Before starting the application, ensure you are logged into Azure:
```bash
az login
```

## Quick Start
To start both the backend and frontend simultaneously, simply run the provided PowerShell script from the root directory:
```powershell
.\start-all.ps1
```

## Manual Startup
If you prefer to start the services individually:

### 1. Start the Backend (.NET API)
```bash
cd KeyVaultComparer.Api
dotnet run
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:5065`

### 2. Start the Frontend (Vue 3 + Vite)
```bash
cd keyvaultcomparer-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```
The UI will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Features
- **Cross-Environment Comparison**: Select multiple Key Vaults and see a unified grid of secrets side-by-side.
- **Smart Color Grouping**: Identical values across different environments are assigned the same color for instantaneous visual matching.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Use Regex or CSV filters to isolate specific secrets without triggering massive downloads from Azure.
- **Server-Side Limits**: Strict global limit enforcement to avoid Azure API throttling.
- **Debounced Autocomplete**: Highly optimized Azure Resource Manager querying with minimum length checks to prevent empty-state spamming.
